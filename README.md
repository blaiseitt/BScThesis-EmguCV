# BScThesis-EmguCV
My BSc Thesis - It is made usign Windows Forms and EmguCV. I also implemented telent communication.

The task was to make terminal for Kawasaki FS03N - that is what telnet communication is for.
EmguCV is used for simple object recognition(Canny) and also for complex object recognition(SURF).
Depending what object was detected - robot performs specific action.

That was my first application ever so code is euphemistically speaking "messy".
